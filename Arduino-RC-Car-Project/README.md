Projects 2 for CSCI 4830

**_Arduino RC Car Project - "An Arduino Controlled Maisto Rock Crawler"_**

**Base Project Description:**

In this project I want to reverse engineer and disassemble an RC Car and replace it's stock onboard circuit board with an Arduino Uno R3 (and Motor Shield). Once
we have the car's motors/servos taking driving instructions from the Arduino we will incorporate a Bluetooth Module (Xbee Wire Antenna) to communicate with a 
wireless remote (PS2 OR XBOX controller). 

**Concept:**
    
    We will need:
    
    RC Car 						- I have a Maisto Rock Crawler (4WD, 2 DC motors for front and back throttle, and 1 Servo for steering)
    Arduino 					- I will be using a Arduino Uno R3 
    Motor and Servo Shield 		- I will use an Adafruit motor shield v2 (For most RC Cars the shield must support 2 DC motors and a Servo)
    Multimeter 					- To test voltages and find what wires are connected to what motors
    Jumper leads and Wires 		- Will need all sorts (Female/Male, Male/Male)
    Bluetooth Module 			- I will use an Xbee wire antenna (Not Pictured)
    WiFi Dongle 				- For streaming of video, I have a WiPi wireless adapter
    9V Battery 					- Can reconfigure battery pack onboard RC Car and/or use single 9v for testing purposes
    Solder and Soldering Iron
    



**Expansive Options:**

    - Add an onboard camera and wirelessly stream video to a phone or a controller mounted display
    - Attach Microphone to pick up audio (Spying device)  
    - Communicate with motors/servos via web server hosted on device, allowing a phone to operate the car
    - Add some autonomous features for obstacle avoidance (i.e Sonar, GPS technology) 
    - Add Speaker to communicate with people around the RC Car
    - Send and process video for use by a virtual reality headset
